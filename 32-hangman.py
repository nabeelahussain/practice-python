# Exercise 32

# In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman.
# In the game of Hangman, the player only has 6 incorrect
# guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.

# In Part 1, we loaded a random word list and picked a word from it.
# In Part 2, we wrote the logic for guessing the letter and displaying
# that information to the user. In this exercise, we have to put it all
# together and add logic for handling guesses.

# Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting
# point. Now add the following features:

# Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
# Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a
# letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.


# Optional additions:

# When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.

# Rather than telling the user "You have 4 incorrect guesses left",
# display some picture art for the Hangman. This is
# challenging - do the other parts of the exercise first!

# Your solution will be a lot cleaner if you make use of functions to help you!
